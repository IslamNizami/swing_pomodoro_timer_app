How to Run:

Prerequisites:
  1.Java JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.
  2.Compatible OS (Windows, Mac, Linux).

Compile and Run:
javac -d out src/org/example/PomodoroTimer.java
java -cp out org.example.PomodoroTimer
Alternatively, import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and run the main method of PomodoroTimer class.

How It Works:
The timer starts in Work state by default with a 25-minute countdown.

When the timer finishes:
  If the current session was Work, it increments the Pomodoro count.
  
  After every 4 Pomodoros, a Long Break (15 mins) starts.
  
  Otherwise, a Short Break (5 mins) starts.
  
  If the session was a break, the timer switches back to Work.
  
  You can pause, reset, or skip the current session anytime.
  
  UI updates dynamically with session progress and state changes.

Code Structure:
  PomodoroTimer.java â€” main JFrame window and logic.
  Uses Swing components: JLabel, JButton, JProgressBar, JOptionPane.
  Timer logic implemented using javax.swing.Timer.
  Enum TimerState defines session types with labels, durations, and colors.

Customization:

You can customize the timer durations by modifying constants in the source code:

  private static final int WORK_TIME = 25 * 60; // seconds
  private static final int SHORT_BREAK = 5 * 60;
  private static final int LONG_BREAK = 15 * 60;
  Colors and UI elements can also be tweaked in the TimerState enum and UI setup methods.
